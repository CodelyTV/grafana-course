# Grafana

Examples used to prepare the [Grafana course](https://pro.codely.com/library/grafana-203964/521119/about/).

## ‚öíÔ∏èÔ∏è Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## üïµÔ∏è Project structure

This repository contains a directory with all the resources (`docker-compose.yml`, configuration, provisioning files,
etc.) for every lesson that required a specific set up of Grafana and any of the other tools of the LGTM stack.

*NOTE: Not all the course lessons contain practical examples that can be reproduced locally, but some are an overview
of some theoretical concepts and some just use an external instance, like [play.grafana.org](https://play.grafana.org/).*
